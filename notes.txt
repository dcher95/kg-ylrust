All data is in grayscale.

Different folders in training refer to specific plots, and different timeframes of photos taken.

MODELING

- Which bands do I want to use?
    - 12 bands are given. 3 are typically used in most ImageNet pretrained models.
    
    If I choose to only use select bands:
        - Use RGB bands of most granular 10m.
            Band 4 (Red) 
            Band 3 (Green) 
            Band 2 (Blue) 
        
        - Create false-color image for vegetation analysis:
            Band 8 (NIR)
            Band 4 (Red) 
            Band 3 (Green)

        - Enhanced vegetation index:
            Band 8 (NIR)
            Band 4 (Red) 
            Band 2 (Blue)

    Some pre-trained models using more bands are available in torchgeo:
        - They have already used SSL, and are available for 13 bands. 
            Could use as a baseline, and adjust head for fine-tuning.


- How do I take into account the temporal effect? 
    - Validation data doesn't have time identifiers, so probably not of consequence. Accounting for time wouldn't help because we don't have that information during evaluation. 
    - Integrating time element would be good skills to learn.
