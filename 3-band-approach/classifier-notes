Noisy labels?
- Very hard to differentiate the different crops looking at RGB images.
- Can't really tell the difference. Any modeling is better that I could do.
- Are they truly divided that well? I feel like these are generally close to one another, and fields may mix, therefore some label smoothing would probably be effective.

Outliers?
- Cloud cover pictures basically make it impossible. 
- Hyperspectral bands is probably necessary to pass through the cloud cover??

Patterns
- Texture seems to be very important. Therefore, high-levels of detail with localized architectures that don't do average pooling are probably better? Experiment to verify??
    - Transformer would probably be worse?
- General shapes of the field may be important? Some may be more uniform than others.
- Spatial positioning is not important. it's all geometric objects - where they are doesn't particularly matter.
